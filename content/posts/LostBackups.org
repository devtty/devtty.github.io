Today someone asked if I‚Äôve got Backups of every piece of code i‚Äôd wrote. Intimidating question and of course *not*.
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve got zipped backups of the last sources for some older ones but in  most cases a backup of the VCS for
the important projects. Somewhere the CVS for the ugly LaTeX things called Diploma thesis too.

I know only two cases were i really regret not having a backup.

The first one is a project I‚Äôve done for a company ten years ago. There was a SVN repo on an USB stick which should be
somewhere in my desk. All these years the delivered product seemed to run flawlessly and I had no contact to the
company. Ten years later the call came in. They are still happy /‚Äònice to hear btw‚Äò/ but there are new requirements
and ideas to extend. Damn it, where is the stick with the old source and docs? Didn‚Äôt found it yet. Ten years‚Ä¶ Good time to write a new version from scratch üòÇ

The second case is a programm I‚Äôd wrote in high school times. I‚Äôve got a backup on a floppy disk (/you know these 3,5 ‚Äù plastic things from ancient times?/).
As kid I started coding with Logo and BASIC. Later I‚Äôve got into Pascal and this programm marks my personal step from procedural to object-orientated
paradigm‚Ä¶ Big step for a kid though. The small programm could calculate or simulate a throw under perfect conditions and with respect to form, size
and drag of the thrown object including a representation of the ballistic curve. I remember that I‚Äôve presented this in physics and not in CompSci.
Got a grade on it‚Ä¶ best one. A year ago I thought it would be a good idea to copy the sources into my repository. At first it was hard to find a
working floppy drive, fingers crossed that the disk is still readable. I‚Äôve found one but -damn it- the only files on the disk were the binary
executable and some compiled libs. Additionally this wasn‚Äôt executable on a modern environment anymore. Decompiling would work (maybe) but it
wouldn‚Äôt be the same as the original written things. So everything left now are the nice memories, a floppy disk and the 1990s version of a start into a comp sciences career.
